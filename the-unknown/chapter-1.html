<p>One beautiful twilight, while the sun slowly sank behind the hills, I stood stock-still reminiscing the ambivalent recollection of the time I had just bid farewell to. I could not help but let myself drown in the sea of nostalgia. I tried basking in the afterglow, but I could not feel the serenity I would usually feel beneath the bronze sky. Instead, I felt the desire to go back and relive more days in the place where I had made formative memories.<br><br>
I was only twelve when I moved with my family from a small town in the suburbs to a different town closer to the city. According to my parents, I was about to begin a new chapter in my life amongst the sublime fortune and delightful facilities the city had to offer. But all I could experience was discomforting chaos and blinding city lights. The scents and sounds were unfamiliar to me. I wanted to go back to the simpler time when everything felt tranquil and undemanding, and I did not have to worry much about anything.<br><br>
But when I tried to relive the past, I came up short. I realized that things were different now and not everything remains constant. No matter how much I tried, things never felt the same. The things that felt so intoxicating and beautiful had now lost their charm, and what once felt like the most prestigious thing was now just a part of history.<br><br>
I quickly came to terms with the discomfort I had faced while moving in and learned that it’s better to move forward and appreciate the past, while also appreciating the present time, and seeing the future as just as exciting. Therefore, I decided it was best for me to tie a bow on those old times and rather work towards crafting my future, while also living the present to its fullest.<br><br>
This experience was also a piercing realization that things change and nothing remains the same forever. Today, I do not think much about the past. I believe in the notion of letting go of the past and moving on. I see new experiences as an opportunity to learn new things and better myself as an individual. I feel enthusiasm in learning something new every day, and I now let my experience and knowledge shape and prepare me for future endeavors.<br><br>
During this process of self-discovery, I also learned that being true to ourselves is what places us one step further in everything that we decide to do in our lives, and it is our mindset that gets us through every hardship we might face along the way. I came to know that having a growth mindset is what keeps us ahead of everyone. So, I have always put in my best effort to have a positive mindset in everything that I do, everywhere I am, and I try to see the light even in the darkest times.<br><br>
Even in school, putting myself out there and participating in activities allowed me to discover topics I would have never imagined myself to be passionate about. Allowing myself to participate in competitions and exhibitions enabled me to nurture my interests and hobbies. The more I got myself to step out of my comfort zone, the more I got to rediscover my true abilities.<br><br>
Therefore, while moving into a different place had troubled me at the beginning, it did not take me long to learn to appreciate what I have instead of feeling unhappy over what I had to leave behind. Now, I do not see change as a loss of anything but an opportunity to grow, thrive, and do better, while making bittersweet memories along the way.
